msgid "<em>Metadata</em> refers to information that describes the content in a machine-friendly way. Search engines and other online services use this metadata to better understand your content. Keep in mind that metadata itself does not automatically make your blog rank better. For this to happen the content is still required to meet various quality standards. However, the presence of accurate and adequate metadata gives search engines and other services the chance to make less guesses about your content, index and categorize it better and, eventually, deliver it to an audience that finds it useful.  Good metadata facilitates this process and thus plays a significant role in achieving better rankings. This is what the Add-Meta-Tags plugin does."

msgid "Add-Meta-Tags tries to follow the \"<em>It just works</em>\" principal. By default, the <em>description</em> and <em>keywords</em> meta tags are added to your blog's front page, posts, pages, category and tag based archives. Furthermore, it is possible to enable the insertion of <em>Opengraph</em> and <em>Dublin Core</em> metadata to your posts and pages. The plugin also supports some extra SEO related functionality that helps you fine tune your web site."
msgstr ""

#: add-meta-tags.php:153
msgid "Customization of the added metadata on a per post/page basis is possible by using the user-friendly <strong>WordPress meta boxes</strong> in the post/page editing panel. In earlier versions of the plugin (before 2.1.0) such customization was possible through custom fields. If you have already used custom fields in order to customize the posts description and keywords in the past, there is nothing to worry about, since the new meta-box functionality is internally based on those custom fields, so there is no migration procedure involved. However, you need to enable the <em>Metadata</em> meta box in the <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/screen-options/\">Screen Options</a> of the post/page editing panel."
