Adds metadata to your content, including the basic description and keywords meta tags, Opengraph and Dublin Core metadata.

== Description ==

*Add-Meta-Tags* adds metadata to your content, including the basic *description* and *keywords* meta tags, [Opengraph](http://ogp.me "Opengraph specification") and [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org "Dublin Core Metadata Initiative") metadata. It is actively maintained since 2006 (historical [Add-Meta-Tags home](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/ "Official historical Add-Meta-Tags Homepage")).

*Metadata* refers to information that describes the content in a machine-friendly way. Search engines and other online services use this metadata to better understand your content. Keep in mind that metadata itself does not automatically make your blog rank better. For this to happen the content is still required to meet various quality standards. However, the presence of accurate and adequate metadata gives search engines and other services the chance to make less guesses about your content, index and categorize it better and, eventually, deliver it to an audience that finds it useful. Good metadata facilitates this process and thus plays a significant role in achieving better rankings. This is what the *Add-Meta-Tags* plugin does.

The following list outlines how and where metadata is added to a *WordPress* blog.

= Basic meta tags =

The *description* and *keywords* meta tags are added:

**Front Page**

- Automatic addition of the blog's tagline in the *description* metatag.
- Automatic addition of the blog's categories in the *keywords* metatag.
- Customization is possible through the plugin's administration panel.
- If a static page is used as the front page, customization is possible at the page's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Posts & Pages**

- Automatic addition of an auto-generated excerpt of the post's or page's content in the *description* metatag. In case a post has a user-defined excerpt, then this is what is used.
- Automatic addition of the post's categories and tags in the *keywords* meta tag. Pages do not support categories and tags, so there is no automatic addition of the *keywords* metatag.
- Customization is possible by adding a custom description and keywords in the post's or page's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Attachment Pages**

- A *description* metatag is automatically generated from the caption or, if a caption has not been set, from the description of the attachment.

**Custom Post Types**

- A description is automatically generated from the first paragraph of the content. Keywords are not generated automatically.
- Customization of the *description* and *keywords* meta tags is possible at the post type's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Category-based Archives**

- The description of the category, if set, is used for the *description* meta tag. The name of the category is always used at the *keywords* metatag.

**Tag-based Archives**

- The description of the tag, if set, is used for the *description* meta tag. The name of the tag is always used at the *keywords* metatag.

= Extended Meta Tag Support =

The following advanced features are also available:

**Global keywords**

- It is possible to set some keywords that are prepended/appended to the keywords of all your content.

**Site-wide META Tags**

- It is possible to force any metatags site-wide.

**Custom title tag**

It is possible to customize the *title* element on posts, pages and public custom post types.

**'news_keywords' meta tag**

It is possible to set a *news_keywords* meta tag for posts, pages and any public custom post type. 
For more info about the *news_keywords* metatag, please read this <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/news/publisher/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=68297">Google help page</a>.

**Per post full meta tags**

It is possible to assign custom full meta tags to single posts (posts, pages, custom post types).

**Copyright Metatag**

It is possible to a head link to a user-defined copyright page.

**Default Image**

A path to an image can be set in order to be used in autogenerated metadata where a *featured image* has not been set.

**Opengraph metadata**

Opengraph meta tags can be automatically added to the front page, posts and pages.

**Dublin Core metadata**

Dublin Core metatags can be automatically added to posts and pages.

**Extra SEO features**

- Add the `NOODP,NOYDIR` option to the robots meta tag.
- Add the `NOINDEX,FOLLOW` options to the robots meta tag on category, tag, author or time based archives and search results.

**Metadata Review Mode**

When enabled, WordPress users with administrator privileges see a box that contains the full metadata (exactly as it is added in the HTML head) above the content for easier examination.

== Installation ==

Add-Meta-Tags can be easily installed through the plugin management interface from within the WordPress administration panel (*recommended*).

Alternatively, you may manually extract the compressed (zip) package in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

After the plugin has been installed, activate it through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Finally, visit the plugin's administration panel at `Options->Metadata` to read the detailed instructions about customizing the generated metatags.

As it has been mentioned, no configuration is required for the plugin to function. It will add meta tags automatically. Full customization is possible though.

== Upgrade Notice ==

No special requirements when upgrading.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Troubleshooting:

= My meta tags do not show up! =

Please, check if your theme's `header.php` file contains the following required piece of code: `<?php wp_head(); ?>`. If this is missing, contact the theme author. Full WordPress functionality requires this.

= My meta tags show up twice! =

The *description* and *keywords* meta tags are most probably already hardcoded into your theme's `header.php` file. Please contact the theme author.

= Where can I get support? =

Add-Meta-Tags is released as free software without warranties. You can get first class support from the [community of users](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/add-meta-tags "Add-Meta-Tags Users").

= I found a bug! =

Please, be kind enough to [file a bug report](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/issues/new "File bug about Add-Meta-Tags") to our issue database. This is the only way to bring the issue to the plugin author's attention.
