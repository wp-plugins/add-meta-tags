Adds metadata to your content, including the description and keywords meta tags, Opengraph, Schema.org Microdata, Twitter Cards and Dublin Core.

== Description ==

*Add-Meta-Tags* adds metadata to your content, including the basic *description* and *keywords* meta tags, [Opengraph](http://ogp.me "Opengraph specification"), [Schema.org](http://schema.org/ "Schema.org Specification"), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards "Twitter Cards Specification") and [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org "Dublin Core Metadata Initiative") metadata. It is actively maintained since 2006 (historical [Add-Meta-Tags home](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/ "Official historical Add-Meta-Tags Homepage")).

*Metadata* refers to information that describes the content in a machine-friendly way. Search engines and other online services use this metadata to better understand your content. Keep in mind that metadata itself does not automatically make your blog rank better. For this to happen the content is still required to meet various quality standards. However, the presence of accurate and adequate metadata gives search engines and other services the chance to make less guesses about your content, index and categorize it better and, eventually, deliver it to an audience that finds it useful. Good metadata facilitates this process and thus plays a significant role in achieving better rankings. This is what the *Add-Meta-Tags* plugin does.

The following list outlines how and where metadata is added to a *WordPress* blog.

= Basic meta tags =

The *description* and *keywords* meta tags are added:

**Front Page**

- Automatic addition of the blog's tagline in the *description* metatag.
- Automatic addition of the blog's categories in the *keywords* metatag.
- Customization is possible through the plugin's administration panel.
- If a static page is used as the front page, customization is possible at the page's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Posts & Pages**

- Automatic addition of an auto-generated excerpt of the post's or page's content in the *description* metatag. In case a post has a user-defined excerpt, then this is what is used.
- Automatic addition of the post's categories and tags in the *keywords* meta tag. Pages do not support categories and tags, so there is no automatic addition of the *keywords* metatag.
- Customization is possible by adding a custom description and keywords in the post's or page's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Attachment Pages**

- A *description* metatag is automatically generated from the caption or, if a caption has not been set, from the description of the attachment.

**Custom Post Types**

- A description is automatically generated from the first paragraph of the content. Keywords are not generated automatically.
- Customization of the *description* and *keywords* meta tags is possible at the post type's editing panel (*Metadata* box).

**Category-based Archives**

- The description of the category, if set, is used for the *description* meta tag. The name of the category is always used at the *keywords* metatag.

**Tag-based Archives**

- The description of the tag, if set, is used for the *description* meta tag. The name of the tag is always used at the *keywords* metatag.

**Author-based Archives**

- The bio of the WordPress user, if set, is used for the *description* meta tag.

= Extended Meta Tag Support =

The following advanced features are also available:

**Global keywords**

- It is possible to set some keywords that are prepended/appended to the keywords of all your content.

**Site-wide META Tags**

- It is possible to force any metatags site-wide.

**Custom title tag**

It is possible to customize the *title* element on posts, pages and public custom post types.

**'news_keywords' meta tag**

It is possible to set a *news_keywords* meta tag for posts, pages and any public custom post type. 
For more info about the *news_keywords* metatag, please read this <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/news/publisher/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=68297">Google help page</a>.

**Per post full meta tags**

It is possible to assign custom full meta tags to single posts (posts, pages, custom post types).

**Copyright Metatag**

It is possible to a head link to a user-defined copyright page.

**Default Image**

A path to an image can be set in order to be used in autogenerated metadata where a *featured image* has not been set.

**Opengraph metadata**

Opengraph meta tags can be automatically added to the front page, posts and pages.

**Schema.org Microdata**

Schema.org Microdata can be automatically added to the front page, posts and pages.

**Twitter Cards**

Twitter Cards can be automatically added to content pages.

**Dublin Core metadata**

Dublin Core metatags can be automatically added to posts and pages.

**Extra SEO features**

- Add the `NOODP,NOYDIR` option to the robots meta tag.
- Add the `NOINDEX,FOLLOW` options to the robots meta tag on category, tag, author or time based archives and search results.

**Metadata Review Mode**

When enabled, WordPress users with administrator privileges see a box that contains the full metadata (exactly as it is added in the HTML head) above the content for easier examination.

**Languages**

= Advanced Customization =

Add-Meta-Tags allows filtering of the generated metatags and also of some core functionality through filters. This way advanced customization of the plugin is possible.

Add-Meta-Tags generates metadata that is used in the head area of the HTML page or embedded in the body (wrapped around the content or in the footer area).

The available filters are:

1. `amt_metadata_head` - applied to all metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the head area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_metadata_footer` - applied to all metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the footer area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_basic_metadata_head` - applied to the basic metatags (description, keywords, etc) that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the head area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_opengraph_metadata_head` - applied to the OpenGraph metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the head area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_twitter_cards_metadata_head` - applied to the Twitter Cards metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the head area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_dublin_core_metadata_head` - applied to the Dublin Core metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the head area of the HTML page. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_schemaorg_metadata_head` - applied to the 'author' and 'publisher' links in the head area of HTML page that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for Google+. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of links.
1. `amt_schemaorg_metadata_footer` - applied to the Schema.org metatags that have been generated by Add-Meta-Tags for the footer area. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of meta tags.
1. `amt_schemaorg_metadata_content` - applied to the Schema.org Microdata that has been generated by Add-Meta-Tags and is embedded around the content. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of microdata. Note that `articleBody` is added to the array after filtering.
1. `amt_get_the_excerpt` - applied to the description that Add-Meta-Tags generates from the first paragraph of the content if no other description has been defined by the user. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: a string.
1. `amt_paged_append_data` - applied to the data that should be appended when paginated content is encountered and a page number greater than 1 is displayed. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: a string.
1. `amt_supported_post_types` - applied to the list of post types Add-Meta-Tags should add metadata to. By default, this list includes posts, pages and all available public post types. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of post types.

*Example 1*: you want to replace the autogenerated `og:site_name` Opengraph metatag with a custom one.

This can easily be done by hooking a custom function to the `amt_opengraph_metadata_head` filter:

`
function customize_og_sitename_metatag( $metatags ) {
    // ... replace 'og:site_name' here
    return $metatags;
}
add_filter( 'amt_opengraph_metadata_head', 'customize_og_sitename_metatag', 10, 1 );
`
This code can be placed inside your theme's `functions.php` file.

*Example 2*: you want to limit the generation of metadata by Add-Meta-Tags to specific post types.

This can easily be done by hooking a custom function to the `amt_supported_post_types` filter:

`
function limit_metadata_to_post_types( $post_types ) {
    // ... process and return the $post_types array
    // ... or just return a custom array of post types
    return array( 'post', 'book', 'projects');
}
add_filter( 'amt_supported_post_types', 'limit_metadata_to_post_types', 10, 1 );
`
This code can be placed inside your theme's `functions.php` file.

= Template Tags =

The following *template tags* are available for use in your theme:

1. `amt_content_description()` : prints the content's description as generated by Add-Meta-Tags.
1. `amt_content_keywords()` : prints a comma-delimited list of the content's keywords as generated by Add-Meta-Tags.
1. `amt_metadata_head()` : prints the full metadata for the head area as generated by Add-Meta-Tags.
1. `amt_metadata_footer()` : prints the full metadata for the head area as generated by Add-Meta-Tags.

== Upgrade Notice ==

No special requirements when upgrading.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Troubleshooting:

= My meta tags do not show up! =

Please, check if your theme's `header.php` file contains the following required piece of code: `<?php wp_head(); ?>`. If this is missing, contact the theme author. Full WordPress functionality requires this.

= My meta tags show up twice! =

The *description* and *keywords* meta tags are most probably already hardcoded into your theme's `header.php` file. Please contact the theme author.
